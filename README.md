**AtHere** is a small command helper intended for Minecraft server operators.
Essentially, it's a more configurable "@a" argument that works on any command.

**Usage Examples:**
/tphere @here
/msg @here hello!
/gamemode creative @here

**Commands:**
/athere exclude <- Toggles on/off whether or not to exclude the issuer
/athere delay (integer) <- Sets the delay in milliseconds between each command's execution

As AtHere's functionality is limited to online players, I advise against using it on commands that don't take in player arguments.
